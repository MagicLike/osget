OSGET TODO

0.3:
* Flesh out and make --information/-i more flexable, take more input etc. DONE!
* Add DOWNLOAD_DIR functionality. Currently it does nothing. DONE!

0.7:
* Allow multiple os downloads using only shortnames. DONE!

0.8:
* Allow arbitrary number of parameters and values for parameters to be passed to osget. DONE!
* Add support for bittorrent via transmission-cli. DONE!

0.9:
* Add a function to verify that all URL's are still valid in all OS configuration files. DONE!
* Add support for updating OS list from an internet mirror. DONE!
* Add checksum checking for downloaded iso files DONE!
* Add multiple mirror support per ISO. DONE!

1.0:
* Add a few more operating systems and versions to the oslist. DONE!

2.0:
Buy and setup a domain for osget to host the official oslist on.

UNKOWN:
* Create a .deb package and a .rpm package. DONE!
* Validate URL only supports HTTP links for now. Needs to be fixed.
* Finish adding every version, architecture and edition of the most major distros.
* Add GPG verification/validation support.
* Swap to using aria2c for torrenting. Transmission-cli seems to be on life support.
  In fact I'd like to expand on this and make multiple torrent clients compatible with
  osget. Transmission-cli will probably remain the default but add a config variable
  for different torrent clients.
* Rewrite the install.sh script. It's old and crusty and doesn't enable people to install
  without root permissions.

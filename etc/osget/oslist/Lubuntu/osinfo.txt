Lubuntu is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Ubuntu and uses the LXQt desktop
environment in place of Ubuntu's GNOME desktop. Lubuntu was originally touted as
being "lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient", but now aims to
be "a functional yet modular distribution focused on getting out of the way and
letting users use their computer". Lubuntu originally used the LXDE desktop, but
moved to the LXQt desktop with the release of Lubuntu 18.10 in October 2018, due
to the slow development of LXDE, losing support for GTK 2 as well as the more active
and stable LXQt development without Gnome dependencies. The name Lubuntu is a portmanteau
of LXQt and Ubuntu. The LXQt name derives from the merger of the LXDE and Razor-qt
projects, while the word Ubuntu means "humanity towards others" in the Zulu and
Xhosa languages. Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal member of the
Ubuntu family on 11 May 2011, commencing with Lubuntu 11.10, which was released
on 13 October 2011.

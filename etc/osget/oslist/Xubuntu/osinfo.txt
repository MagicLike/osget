Xubuntu is a Canonical Ltd.â€“recognized, community-maintained derivative of the Ubuntu
operating system. The name Xubuntu is a portmanteau of Xfce and Ubuntu, as it uses
the Xfce desktop environment, instead of Ubuntu's GNOME desktop. Xubuntu seeks to
provide "a light, stable and configurable desktop environment with conservative
workflows" using Xfce components. Xubuntu is intended for both new and experienced
Linux users. Rather than explicitly targeting low-powered machines, it attempts
to provide "extra responsiveness and speed" on existing hardware.

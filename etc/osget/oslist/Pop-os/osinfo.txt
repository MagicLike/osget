Pop!_OS is a free and open-source Linux distribution, based upon Ubuntu, featuring
a custom GNOME desktop. The distribution is developed by American Linux computer
manufacturer System76. Pop!_OS is primarily built to be bundled with the computers
built by System76, but can also be downloaded and installed on most computers. Pop!_OS
provides full out-of-the-box support for both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. It is regarded
as an easy distribution to set up for gaming, mainly due to its built-in GPU support.
Pop!_OS provides default disk encryption, streamlined window and workspace management,
keyboard shortcuts for navigation as well as built-in power management profiles.
The latest releases also have packages that allow for easy setup for TensorFlow
and CUDA. Pop!_OS is maintained primarily by System76, with the release version
source code hosted in a GitHub repository. Unlike many other Linux distributions,
it is not community-driven, although outside programmers can contribute, view and
modify the source code. They can also build custom ISO images and redistribute them

Solus (previously known as Evolve OS) is an independently developed operating system
for the x86-64 architecture based on the Linux kernel and a choice of the homegrown
Budgie desktop environment, GNOME, MATE or KDE Plasma as the desktop environment.
Its package manager, eopkg, is based on the PiSi package management system from
Pardus Linux, and it has a semi-rolling release model, with new package updates
landing in the stable repository every Friday. The developers of Solus have stated
that Solus is intended exclusively for use on personal computers and will not include
software that is only useful in enterprise or server environments.

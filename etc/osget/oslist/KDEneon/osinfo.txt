KDE neon is a Linux distribution developed by KDE based on the most recent Ubuntu
long-term support (LTS) release, bundled with a set of additional software repositories
containing the latest 64-bit versions of the Plasma 5 desktop environment/framework,
Qt 5 toolkit and other compatible KDE software. First announced in June 2016 by
Kubuntu founder Jonathan Riddell following his departure from Canonical Ltd., it
has been adopted by a steadily growing number of Linux users, regularly appearing
in the Top 20 on DistroWatch.com's popularity tables. It is offered in stable and
development variants; the User Edition is a stable release featuring the latest
KDE packages that have passed quality assurance, while the Testing, Unstable, and
Developer Edition branches use the latest beta and unstable nightly releases of
KDE packages (the last of which bundled with KDE development libraries and head
ers).

openmediavault is the next generation network attached storage (NAS) solution based on Debian Linux. 
It contains services like SSH, (S)FTP, SMB/CIFS, DAAP media server, RSync, BitTorrent client and many more. 
Thanks to the modular design of the framework it can be enhanced via plugins. Openmediavault is primarily 
designed to be used in small offices or home offices, but is not limited to those scenarios. 
It is a simple and easy to use out-of-the-box solution that will allow everyone to install and administrate 
a Network Attached Storage without deeper knowledge.

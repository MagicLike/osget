Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a configurable desktop environment. 
It is ideal for those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. 
With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and 
older hardware alike. Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old computers usable.

TrueNAS is the branding for a range of free and open-source network-attached storage
(NAS) operating systems produced by iXsystems, and based on FreeBSD and Linux, using
the OpenZFS file system. It is licensed under the terms of the BSD License and runs
on commodity x86-64 hardware. The TrueNAS range includes free public versions (TrueNAS
CORE, previously known as FreeNAS), commercial versions (TrueNAS Enterprise), Linux
versions (TrueNAS SCALE, under development as of January 2021), and hardware from
small home systems to 10 petabyte arrays, based on these. TrueNAS supports Windows,
macOS and Unix clients and various virtualization hosts such as XenServer and VMware
using the SMB, AFP, NFS, iSCSI, SSH, rsync and FTP/TFTP protocols. Advanced TrueNAS
features include full-disk encryption and a plug-in architecture for third-party
software.

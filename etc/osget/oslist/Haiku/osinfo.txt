Haiku is a free and open-source operating system compatible with the now discontinued
BeOS. Its development began in 2001, and the operating system became self-hosting
in 2008. The first alpha release was made in September 2009, and the last was November
2012; the first beta was released in September 2018, followed by beta 2 in June
2020 and beta 3 in July 2021. Haiku is supported by Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization
based in Rochester, New York, United States, founded in 2003 by former project leader
Michael Phipps.

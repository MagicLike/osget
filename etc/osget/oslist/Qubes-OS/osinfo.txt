Qubes OS is a security-focused desktop operating system that aims to provide security
through isolation. Virtualization is performed by Xen, and user environments can
be based on Fedora, Debian, Whonix, and Microsoft Windows, among other operating
systems. Systems like Qubes are referred to in academia as Converged Multi-Level
Secure (MLS) Systems. Other proposals of similar systems have surfaced and SecureView
is a commercial competitor, however Qubes OS is the only system of the kind actively
being developed under a FOSS license.

MX Linux is a cooperative venture between the antiX and MX Linux communities. 
It is a family of operating systems that are designed to combine elegant and efficient desktops with high stability and solid performance.  
MXâ€™s graphical tools provide an easy way to do a wide variety of tasks, while the Live USB and snapshot tools inherited from antiX add 
impressive portability and remastering capabilities. Extensive support is available through videos, documentation and a very friendly Forum.
